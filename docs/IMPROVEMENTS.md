### üí° Centralized Handling of Integration Errors 

  ### **Consistent Error Logging**
  - Centralizing errors ensures every error is reported in a standardized format, which makes Sentry logs more structured and easier to search or filter.

  - You can add tags and contexts to enrich the Sentry logs automatically.

  ### **Better Alerting & Monitoring**
   - You can classify errors and trigger Sentry alerts only for critical cases.
    
   - This helps you prioritize real production issues over expected or transient ones.

  ### **Improved Debugging**
   - With a centralized handler, you can include extra context (e.g., request payload, headers, user ID, model used) in every error report sent to Sentry.
   
   - This saves time when reproducing or debugging issues.

### üîê Security Improvements

 To address the exposure of `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY` in the frontend (such as with GitHub Pages), we propose the following improvements:


 ### 1. Remove OpenAI API Key from Frontend

- Eliminate VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY from all client-side .env files and code.

- Never expose secret keys in client-side JavaScript.

- Remember: anything bundled by the browser can be inspected by users.

### 2. Move OpenAI Requests to a Secure Backend

- Create a backend API (e.g., using Node.js, Express).

- Store `OPENAI_API_KEY` in server-side environment variables (not prefixed with VITE_).

- Keep the API key isolated and never send it to the client.

### 7. Use Next.js with API Routes or Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

üí° Recommended for fullstack React apps.

- With Next.js, you can:

  - Use API routes (/pages/api/chat.js) to securely handle OpenAI requests.

  - Store secrets in server-only .env files (process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY).

  - Use Server-side Rendering (SSR) or Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) to securely generate responses using OpenAI on the server side.

- Hosted easily on Vercel with built-in support for secure env vars and serverless functions.
