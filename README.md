## ðŸ¤– How to Set Up OpenAI API Key

The application includes AI-powered writing assistance that helps users write better descriptions. Here's how to set it up:

### Option 1: Use Without OpenAI (Recommended for Testing)
The application works perfectly without an OpenAI API key by providing realistic mock responses. Simply start the development server and the AI features will use mock data.

### Option 2: Set Up OpenAI API Key (For Production)

#### Step 1: Create OpenAI Account
1. Go to [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/)
2. Sign up for an account or log in if you already have one
3. You'll need to add a payment method to use the API.

#### Step 2: Generate API Key
1. Navigate to [API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
2. Click **"Create new secret key"**
3. Give it a name (e.g., "Social Support App")
4. Copy the generated key immediately (you won't be able to see it again)

#### Step 3: Add API Key to Environment
Open your `.env` file and add your OpenAI API key:

```env
# OpenAI Configuration
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-api-key-here

```
